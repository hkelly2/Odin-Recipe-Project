# Odin Recipe Project

## Descripton
This is my solution for the Odin Project's recipe project.

## Screenshots

## Future Improvements
- More recipes
- More professional styling
- Better compatability with devices with smaller screens
- Fully filled out homepage

## Learning Outcomes and Extra Additions
The goal of this project is to practice simple html: linking pages together, formatting, and filling pages with content like text, images, and links to other sites.

I used this prohect to practice very basic css by adding color and alignment to the headers and giving all the text a different font.

I also looked to other recipe websites and noticed that many recipes on them included personal stories and extra information beyond the recipe in the description. I was inspired to include my own made up stories to make this project feel more like a real reicpe blog.
