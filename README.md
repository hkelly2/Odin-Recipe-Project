## Learning Outcomes and Extra Additions
The goal of this project is to practice simple html: linking pages together, formatting, and filling pages with content like text, images, and links to other sites. Another goal was to practice using GitHub professionally. I did not do the best job at this in the beginning because I did not start commiting until I had completed a lot of the project. The first commits will look a little but off because it attempted to make the commit history look like how it should if i had been commitiing regularly sonce the beginning of the project. For the future of this project and all other ones I plan to commit changes from the very beginning.

I used this project to practice very basic css by adding color and alignment to the headers and giving all the text a different font.

I also looked to other recipe websites and noticed that many recipes included personal stories and extra information beyond the recipe in the description. I was inspired to include my own made up stories to make this project feel more like a real reicpe blog.
