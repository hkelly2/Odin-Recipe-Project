        <p>
            Get ready to make Holt Kelly's famous hotdog pasta! this simple 3, <a href="../4.html">4</a> or 5 ingredient dish will knock your socks off so violently that your feet will get knocked off too. This recipe makes about <a href="../4.html">4</a> servings, or just one if that's your thing. I like to pick the cheapest ingredients I can find at <a href="https://www.wincofoods.com/">WinCo</a>, but you really could find them anywhere if you look hard enough. One legendary time I found a perfectly pristine <a href="../4.html">4</a> pound box of elbow shape pasta laying out on the sidewalk as I walked home. It probably fell out of someones grocery bag or something, but I brought it home and eventually used it to make many meals to feed me and this strange creature thing I keep locked in a cage in the cabinet under my sink. I mean, why get a garbage disposal when there are perfectly good strange creature things you can shovel all your unwanted food scraps into am I right? Anyway, you may think that using a box of pasta you found on the ground outside is a weird and gross thing to do. Well, if you think that you wouldn't be wrong; the unlikely encounter with that box of pasta is exactly what inspired me to create this weird and gross recipe! What's a better way to use a gross box of pasta than to make a gross meal?

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../4.html">4</a> regular size hotdogs <em>Not jumbo!</em></li>
            <li>1 lbs Elbow shape pasta</li>
            <li>~16 oz Red pasta sauce</li>
            <li>An amount chili powder</li>
            <li>Optional: Other spices</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recpie</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Trun on the stove and put it at the highest setting.</li>
            <li>Grab a big giant pot and fill it up with water from the sink or wherever about halfway.</li>
            <li>Put this put right on the burner so it wil eventually boil. Put a lid on the pot so it will boil faster!</li>
            <li>While the water is boiling, get a pan and put it on another burner. Set this one to like the middle setting or something.</li>
            <li>Now, get out a cutting board and slice those <a href="../4.html">4</a> hotdogs into little bits. Yes, really! Little bits! Stay with me here.</li>
            <li>Once your water has reached a rolling boil, throw in all that elbow shape pasta and set a timer for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Go back to your little bits and add as much chili powder as you think you can stand. Stir those bits so they can collect all the powder. This is also when you can add any other spices.</li>
            <li>Stir your elbow shape pasta every minute or so to keep it from sticking. Be sure to watch your little bits and turn off the burner once they are sufficiently heated.</li>
            <li>Pour the red sauce over the hotdogs. This will heat up the sauce.</li>
            <li>Once your timer has concluded, fish out one of the noodles and test if it is cooked through. Use whatever testing method you feel comfortable with. If it is not ready, wait one minute and test again. If it is ready, drain the pasta with a colander.</li>
            <li>Put the pasta into a serving bowl. Pour the bits and sauce over the pasta and serve!</li>
