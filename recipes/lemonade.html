        The creature hates this stuff, but I can't get enough. It would rather drink pig's blood and lard. What a loser! This stuff really will change your life. I have been making batches of this in between making cookies for the creature thing and I have had to scale this recipe up <a href="../4.html">4</a> times to match the amount of it I consume. Get ready for your new vice.

        <li>Combine sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Stir to dissolve sugar while mixture comes to a boil. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, roll lemons around on your counter to soften. Cut in half crosswise, and squeeze into a liquid measuring cup. Add pulp to the juice, but discard any seeds. Continue juicing until you have 1 Â½ cups fresh juice and pulp.</li>
        <li>Pour 7 cups ice-cold water into a pitcher. This is also when you can add any other spices. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste. Add ice.</li>
