            These incredible 5 ingredient Peanut Butter Cookies will change your life. No, I'm not kidding. Your life will be forever altered by the introduction of these cookies. You will never want another cookie again! At least, that's what the strange creature thing I keep locked in a cage in the cabinet under my sink tells me when it eats them. I am deathly allergic to peanuts so I really shouldn't be eating these. I really shouldn't be making them either but that creature thing really gets on my ass about making them at least once every few hours or so. I have to wear big, thick gloves and a mask to keep from having an allergic reaction. I am so tired from having to stay up all night making these cookies over and over, but at least there's only a few ingredients so it's not too complicated. I have had to use <a href="../4.html">four</a> Epipens already and I don't know when this will end.
